## Overview

This project tracks covid vaccination progress in Illinois, broken down by county.

## Python Version

This section uses python with matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook. It displays a graph of daily 1st and 2nd doses as well as running averages of each.

The notebook displays a graph of daily 1st and 2nd doses as well as running averages of each. It takes user input to run the analysis for the state as a whole or for a specific county or the city of Chicago(shown in the screenshot above).

## Javascript Version

In progress! My goal is to expand the project with additional data and visualizations in D3.

## Data

This analysis uses the statewide daily vaccine data published here: https://www.dph.illinois.gov/content/covid-19-vaccine-administration-data


## To Run

Run Illinois_Vaccination_Data_from_JSON.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. When prompted, enter an illinois county or leave blank and hit return for statewide analysis.
